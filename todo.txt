NOW:
review all errors messages thrown by flex
think of a better name for declaration() function in Parser.java (should still remind that is a stmt, since statement() function should parse a littler group of statements)

END STAGES OF DEV:
determine which error in scanner should be fatal (stop program execution) and which not
implement different type of assignments
static checking for variables accessing without prior definition (not at runtime)
